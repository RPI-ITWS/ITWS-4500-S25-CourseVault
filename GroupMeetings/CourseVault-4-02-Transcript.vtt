1 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.840
Okay, so it's recorded, it's recording let me just text Mayas. Okay.

2 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.150
So Adam, how are you doing on your CSS stuff?

3 "Adam" (910670336)
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.351
I'm making progress today, I had to do homework yesterday.

4 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.753
Okay, so where how how much do you think you're done right now?

5 "Adam" (910670336)
00:00:44.753 --> 00:01:00.430
Well, I mean like I said yesterday, all the pages are dynamic except for the ******* nav bar. So, and she said something about the nav bar, but Loki I don't want to say like I didn't ******* understand her through her accent.

6 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.835
Okay.

7 "Adam" (910670336)
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.972
Did she, like, did you did you catch what she.

8 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:07.047
Said, I don't remember.

9 "Adam" (910670336)
00:01:07.047 --> 00:01:15.114
Yeah, so, whatever I'll figure it out because yeah, I haven't I haven't touched it since.

10 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:21.210
Yesterday. Yeah, also can you approve my my PR I made yesterday? All it does is.

11 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:38.035
It adds a little bit of functionality to the admin page and it did change some of the CSS. All it did was basically for my backward page and upload backward page, I I changed the format to look more like the other pages.

12 "Adam" (910670336)
00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:39.853
Yeah, right.

13 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:49.232
And then the every course page I just made the, each of the classes look like the rest the rest of the pages.

14 "Adam" (910670336)
00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:54.412
Does that screw up? Cause, like, obviously I've been working on my own branch, does that screwed that.

15 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:01:54.412 --> 00:02:04.874
Okay, I'm thinking since have you actually physically changed anything that's not the, the app media part of the CSS?

16 "Adam" (910670336)
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:10.650
A little bit, but nothing that's like too major it's like you said, it's mostly just the ammunity.

17 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:22.409
Yeah, probably what you'll have to do is you'll just probably have to see if I changed anything that you changed. If you do, you're gonna have to just, you can probably just copy it.

18 "Adam" (910670336)
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.989
He just changed my stuff back.

19 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:43.771
And then we can see. But overall I didn't change that much about it. I also, hey Mayas, I'm trying to figure out why you can't see the data.

20 "Thomas, Mius " (1681459200)
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:50.768
Okay, I can download compass. I just haven't used it yet.

21 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:02:50.768 --> 00:03:18.070
Yeah, NO, the funny thing is I had the same I had where I can't see it on the page itself, but once I do the connections strings, I can see it. And I think Christian has the same thing. So I think like if you download compass, and then connect that way, I think you'll be able to see the data there.

22 "Thomas, Mius " (1681459200)
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.148
Okay, I'll do it right.

23 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:36.840
Yeah, oh, let me see, maybe it might be just because now it might be network access might not be.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.407
Let me add IP address.

25 "Adam" (910670336)
00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:47.407
Okay.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:03:47.407 --> 00:04:07.450
Okay. I might I might have fixed it, I'm not entirely sure maybe.

27 "Adam" (910670336)
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.947
What were the two pages you said you changed the admin and the.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:24.247
Upload backward. I I did the upload upload backward page, the backward page, and then I think it's called every course.CSS.

29 "Adam" (910670336)
00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:33.511
Yeah, ok. I changed a little bit more than the media, but like I can see it, so I'll probably just play with it.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:57.989
If you move those over to your branch as well just to see them, I I think that won't be too bad. No. And and most of it was just like you you remember my upload, my my backward page, there's just a white background with blue buttons. Now it's dark brown buttons that turn light brown when you hover over them and.

31 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:13.499
The table fits the style of the rest of the web sorry also yeah also let me send you, what the Excel looks like.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:30.899
Of the, yeah, let me send you the let me export the data so you can at least see it real quick ok export data full collection JSON.

33 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:53.661
Oh Export data full collection JSON, ok, so let me add these two files for you.

34 "Thomas, Mius " (1681459200)
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:58.040
Okay, I I can see it on compass now. Yeah, you're.

35 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:17.939
You're right. Okay. That's so weird. Yeah, I don't know why it's like that. I also sent you the data in our discord. So look at the users, you can see every user underneath their hashed password now has the.status attribute.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:44.572
So all of our accounts are admins, but if you go down to like 2nd to last one, this, I made one named after one of my swim buddies His name is John Hobbin. He's has the status of users, so if we log in as John, theoretically he should go to the user homepage, but all of us when we log in should go to the admin home page.

37 "Thomas, Mius " (1681459200)
00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:47.648
And that makes sense.

38 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:53.474
That, that might I don't know how are you intending to approach it if you haven't.

39 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:06:53.474 --> 00:06:55.169
Started or what? Yeah.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:03.015
Or just like handling like the users going to unauthorized pages or if they go to an unau.

41 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:05.909
Authorized page just direct them back to the user homepage.

42 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:11.170
Okay, so are we gonna do like we'll we'll just do it through the front end kind of.

43 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:24.614
Like that, we could, yeah, that should not be that hard to do. It's just like check check that's the 1st thing you do when you load a new page, like an admin page is you just check whether the user is an admin, if not then you just redirect them.

44 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:31.575
To the user page. Well, good news is I just added the status attribute view, so I'll I'll take care of that.

45 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.433
Okay. Yeah, so I made an API.

46 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:58.549
Dot get request that basically looks at are you logged in or not? If you're not logged in, it says unknown. If you're logged in, it'll then check to see if your user and admin and then return those statuses. So, I'll I'll add that to all the pages except for what is it, your page Chris.

47 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:07:58.549 --> 00:07:59.811
Then.

48 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:31.834
Okay. Yeah, I'll do it for the rest of the pages, test it out, make a push to it, and then I'll let you know how it goes that so then you get implemented on yours so I don't break anything that you're currently working on yeah but other than that and Adam just make sure you get the CSS worked out. Adam, if you need help with the the now bar, ask Marius for some help.

49 "Adam" (910670336)
00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:33.593
Okay.

50 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:47.034
Cause I'm gonna try and implement the, the rerouting stuff and then I'll also finish up the last feature of the admin page and then I think we should be good.

51 "Adam" (910670336)
00:08:47.034 --> 00:08:49.373
Nope, that sounds good.

52 "Collins, Joshua" (140841472)
00:08:49.373 --> 00:08:56.572
Yes, and with that, I bidd you guys a very well. I'll see you guys on Friday.

53 "Thomas, Mius " (1681459200)
00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:58.073
Yeah.

54 "Christian" (1066914560)
00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:02.268
See you. See it.
