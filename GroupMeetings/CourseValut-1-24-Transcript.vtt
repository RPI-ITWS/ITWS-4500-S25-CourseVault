10 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:11.495
To be honest. My only issue with that is I do have left right after.

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:41.467

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:50.417
So what time do you have lab? Four. Oh, so is 01:00 p.m.. Okay or is.

17 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:55.374
Not that time. I mean, if we need to, I can do it, I just prefer not to.

18 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:01:55.374 --> 00:02:14.100
Yeah online, so it wouldn't be the other one. How about, I mean I could do Mondays, but I'd want it to be like at like seven or eight or actually NO I can't do eight.

19 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.775
Like seven.

20 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:21.632
Guys, I can do that. I can again like I said, I can still do Wednesday.

21 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:25.833
One if we need to. But that would be that would be really tight because like I have a meeting at.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:37.952
Okay go to the google drive. There should be an untitled spreadsheet and just put in when you're busy as like just a joelling.

23 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:40.429
Okay.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:49.831
That way we can work out free times. And I'll also include Saturdays and Sundays.

25 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:53.035
Oh dude, 24 h clock, I don't know.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:58.371
Yeah, can you change that to a different not 24 h?

27 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:02.816
We can you speak or one is good?

28 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.991
And we could just Yeah.

29 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:13.095
This this this is the worse than what is good I'm not gonna lie. Okay.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:16.192
Wait, what's what when is good?

31 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:21.415
It's basically this and you can just paint over, like, times.

32 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:25.573
Yeah, it's like it's like basically this but like automat.

33 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:28.976
Yeah, yeah.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.941
So yeah.

35 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:35.279
Okay, I'll make it.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:52.920
Yeah, I'll I'll delete this real quick yeah cause I mean, the rough part is until March or until after spring break, I'm basically out of pocket four to six every day.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:02.162
It might, it might benefit us to do like a Saturday night one and then finding one during the weekday.

38 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:04.177
But we only have to do one proper.

39 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:11.679
Two per week, two a week but you remember we did two a week.

40 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:18.578
Last time, but I guess I am misremembering. When did we do ok I know we did Monday. Oh, we must have done Monday and.

41 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:23.198
Thursday because we did. Yeah, cause everyone would have the same schedule.

42 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:34.162
I don't know week weekends are I can I can do them much necessary but right now.

43 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:04:34.162 --> 00:05:09.598
I don't know. Well, we'll see what the one is good says, but everyone puts the thing in.

44 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:26.561
Okay, and also we should design them right where there's a decent amount of work between the two because if we have like Monday and Wednesday obviously not a lot's gonna be get going to get.

45 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.881
Done in the one day.

46 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:38.239
Yeah th that's why I will say a Saturday one is good. Oh, is that the logo you were thinking about?

47 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:43.356
Oh, yeah, yeah. I sent it in the.

48 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:49.459
They sent the one is good. So, so does green mean is good for you to mean or is green were blocking off?

49 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:55.741
Green is good. Yeah.

50 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:05:55.741 --> 00:06:03.236
No, ok.

51 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:10.393
I'd rather not do that day.

52 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:14.279
Not two to four.

53 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:26.019
Nope, nope, I guess. Yeah.

54 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:34.397
Also the problem with the Wednesday one is that again it's in the middle of the week so it would kinda be if we did that would be Wednesday and weekend.

55 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:36.896
I guess isn't the worst.

56 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:44.455
Only it's like Sunday wouldn't be the worst idea.

57 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:56.578
But I'm kind of cooked man.

58 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:10.238
Alright, so when we submit, can we when everyone submits, do we then see you? There's it only the host that sees.

59 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:17.415
Oh, I don't know if I can make it so that everyone can, I guess.

60 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:23.039
You can just post a photo and yeah.

61 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.538
Okay.

62 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:33.623
Oh, also is the photo you you put in the discord, is that like the four different options or is that the whole logo?

63 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:07:33.623 --> 00:07:44.083
The, the four like different like colors are just different colors I was playing with and then below are like different font weights.

64 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:50.039
Just messing with. Okay. Both of the ideas look good. I have to admit.

65 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:07:50.039 --> 00:08:00.564
Alright, can you I have to drive my friend to campus. I'm just staying on the call. I'm still gonna be here I just don't I'm not gonna be at my laptop.

66 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:08.942
I mean we have been recording for almost 10 min, so I think we're pretty good for at least for most we just need to figure out.

67 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:10.361
The, that meeting.

68 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:16.681
I think we're good. Yeah. And then once we filled out my one is good, so same. Yeah.

69 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:19.321
Who do you see it?

70 "Thomas, Mius" (1134040064)
00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:37.039
Yeah. Is there any like is there any common like times pretty much like all day Sunday and then Mondays and Tuesdays at 7pM. Actually I'll just send I just sent like the results.

71 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.084
Yeah, please.

72 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:44.723
****, that's kinda.

73 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:49.421
We could.

74 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:51.862
We could do the Wednesday at one.

75 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:54.204
Sunday and Wednesday would.

76 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:08:54.204 --> 00:09:07.315
That would be. Yeah, because that way yeah if we do like Sunday at one at one, that kind of gives us a good range of that gives us two days to work and three days to work. Wait, actually.

77 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:16.378
I think that actually fine. I mean, that's the same ****. I thought I thought that was another like better distribution, but there isn't.

78 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:30.455
I mean Loki, like to be honest, I'm probably not gonna get like almost anything done between Sunday and Wednesday cause I just have a lot of work between those days, but I'll probably have a lot between the other two.

79 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:09:30.455 --> 00:09:49.977
Yeah, I mean, it's not like you have to have work done, it's more of like let's talk about main ideas on Sunday and then like there's gonna be like a quick brush up and if we have a lot, a lot of them done, then what can we do too?

80 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:54.076
Add to it. Right.

81 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:09:54.076 --> 00:10:00.913
Yeah, let's be honest, we're all go getters. I know we're gonna be busy at.

82 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:02.078
Different points that are.

83 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:11.099
There's nothing we can do about that. But as long as we do our best to stay on top of this since it's a large majority of our grade, we should be fine.

84 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:13.495
Alright. Well.

85 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:10:13.495 --> 00:10:17.916
Essentially I'm brute forcing to be good at JavaScript this semester, so let's hope that.

86 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:22.254
And ok also so we're good then.

87 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:27.779
Right, so I missed the what when do we decide on sunday? Like time wise?

88 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:34.013
I think I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna I'm gonna repost what you just said because I'm gonna pin.

89 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:34.013 --> 00:10:37.033
Message yeah yeah I'm fine on some.

90 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.575
They just obviously I'm sure you guys too would rather be like later in the.

91 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:48.573
Well, I was gonna say 01:00 P.M. on Sunday just to keep it simple because that means both days will be at the same time.

92 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:52.956
Yeah, I think that's better. Just keep it at the same time so that.

93 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:55.496
There's less confusion. Yeah.

94 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:10:58.436 --> 00:11:04.576
Last group is people just We can never like pin down a time.

95 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:11:04.576 --> 00:11:14.275
Yeah, I mean my group I was just I just had a good group like we were pretty consistent, but if you really want to do 01:00 P.M. then I'm not gonna like argue against.

96 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:20.293
Yeah, and I think we're at a good spot I'm gonna end the recording unless there's any other remark.

97 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:24.773
If you guys want to add it? Do we wanna like go over presentation at all like who wants to do whatever.

98 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:47.690
Should we just do that tomorrow like. Oh I think we should do that now honestly, like put our names on the slides about what we're presenting. I already put my on there. So there's speaker notes where you could just put what you're yeah what it seems like you, some of you already done that, so just just put like names and the slides you're presenting and then we'll go over it, I guess like.

99 "Adam" (2668226048)
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.655
I don't know. Yeah, I made like 90 % of the presentations so I'll just give me two slides to go.

100 "Collins, Joshua" (4207014144)
00:11:53.655 --> 00:12:02.735
Yeah, so we don't have to worry about the don't worry about the slide one and slide ten. Slide ten I'll cover cause it's a quick.

101 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:12:02.735 --> 00:12:05.456
It's like to start it. I already already put my name on the summary.

102 "Marinkovich, Christian" (2398897920)
00:12:07.372 --> 00:12:11.151
I don't know which slide you were referring to slide one. Oh.
