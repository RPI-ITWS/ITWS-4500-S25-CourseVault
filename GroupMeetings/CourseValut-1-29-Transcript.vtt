Okay.

2 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:09.580
How are you doing on your your work Christian?

3 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.061
If you. I have not made much progress. I mean I set up the VM.

4 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:14.960
Obviously.

5 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:34.282
I guess last time, right? Cause I got the VM set up and we have to we might have to I still have to do the config file config like the edit the config files, but I could do that and then I'll get started on the homepage sounds.

6 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:46.805
Good and I'm gonna share my screen at least to show what I have and I I do plan on implementing that small little, like the colors at the bottom of the tabs to differentiate differentiate them. Yeah.

7 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:51.664
But currently this is what I have for our login page.

8 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.276
So it kind of looks like a manila folder where you have home.

9 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:56.782
Backward wait, soon, though?

10 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:00:56.782 --> 00:01:11.524
Right now they don't go anywhere because of us not having those pages yet, but if we come down here to the more tab and click login, it'll send us back here again. Okay.

11 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:01:11.524 --> 00:01:16.404
Oh, did you change the colors to Maron for the birds?

12 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:20.583
I will. I'm also gonna make this box a little bigger.

13 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:25.685
Honestly I think the login like button should also be.

14 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:32.489
Yeah, I will. Yeah, I'll add that as well. I was just trying to I was trying to get it to look like a piece of paper in the Manila folder.

15 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:37.189
Oh, ok. Yeah, that looks good.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.408
Yeah, I'll just make it a little bit bigger. Yeah, make that make.

17 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:46.990
That like form login form a little bigger, and then that looks good. Yeah.

18 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.610
And I plan on doing that tonight. I, I just got back from the eye dr. right now. I see. Yeah, your man's got pink.

19 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.150
Yeah. Oh shoot, if y'all, I haven't had that in like years, like probably 15 years.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.686
That's crazy. Yeah, NO. Yeah, it's kind it's kind of common with swimmers, so I'm not.

21 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:11.110
Not really? That's what.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.661
Yeah, but, I'll make those changes and push it that ways and Adam both have stuff to go off of.

23 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.983
And then.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:27.271
You learn react, we can always go back and change that template, and also that's just a draft, if anybody doesn't like it, just let me know. Yeah.

25 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:33.983
By the time I get started with mine, we might have we might already have them.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:35.210
Yeah, NO.

27 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.627
Worries. I'll probably just go off a minute.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:44.848
Yeah, and I know we're all busy between the new lab that just got assigned and other classes.

29 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:51.528
Yeah. Today is like a cook day I got like 13 h without even going back to the door.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:02:51.528 --> 00:03:03.482
Yeah, NO worries. And good news is based off of everybody else's reaction to me even starting the HTML, we are ahead of schedule.

31 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:14.409
Yeah oh yeah that that was hilarious option. I was like, you guys already started coding and then he just looked at us in this for a week. I was funny. That's good though.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:29.161
Yeah, it's definitely a good start but yeah is there anything else we need to Oh, considering that's the only thing done right now, I don't think we need to reassign any new tasks.

33 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.771
Yeah, we're we're.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:48.969
Good for now. Yeah, because we're still working on yeah and I'm gonna make a few tweaks to that today. I should have a pull request out by like 03:00 today and when you guys approves it then we can make changes from there.

35 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.168
Okay. Yeah.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:03:52.168 --> 00:04:03.729
And but yeah, most of the functionality on that page is pretty bare because I didn't want to add too many things in, that get in the way of Mayas or Adam going forward.

37 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:13.552
Yeah, so, I mean that's about it for me. Is there anything you guys wanna say?

38 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:23.111
I got really, really nothing. I mean, I didn't really get, I didn't have enough time to really get anything done kind of helping with other classes.

39 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:34.664
Yeah, yeah. I haven't done anything yet. That that's fine. It I mean to be fair, we're busy and also there was only a two day gap between our last sprint meeting.

40 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:04:34.664 --> 00:04:41.047
Yeah, yeah. I'm middle of the week I usually don't get much done like weekend this week.

41 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:50.289
Absolutely. So, yeah, I guess that's about it to be honest, I mean, I don't think these videos have to be particularly long.

42 "Adam" (136661760)
00:04:50.289 --> 00:05:00.693
Yeah I'll text you about like whatever, just like questions and like what we actually want to get done with the login.

43 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:02.711
Yeah.

44 "Adam" (136661760)
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:14.706
But I don't know I'll probably low key cook on like Friday Saturday because I have to like I I just have a like part of my project due on Friday so.

45 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:18.030
Cooking. Yeah.

46 "Adam" (136661760)
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.350
So, you know, just time management.

47 "Collins, Joshua" (770573056)
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:31.177
Yep, well, I guess with that we're pretty good to just disembark I mean.

48 "Christian" (1202649856)
00:05:31.177 --> 00:05:34.332
Yeah, we're good.
