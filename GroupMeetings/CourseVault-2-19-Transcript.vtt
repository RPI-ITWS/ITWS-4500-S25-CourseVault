00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:17.202
Okay, but I can figure that out within the next few days, but I just figured I'd.

17 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:29.744
Let's go with the JSON file and just write to it and we don't we don't need to do like we can just have a JSON file up for now. I'm I'd want to focus more on the front end cause we gotta have something to show on the on the 20.

18 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:01:29.744 --> 00:01:38.748

19 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:01:38.748 --> 00:02:06.468
Yeah, for me, I haven't really done much. I've been kind of like busy with other stuff and I plan on this weekend hopefully getting the professor meeting. So that's kind of like what I'm trying to get the front end done for that. I don't know if I'll have time to convert it all to like react or not, but if.

20 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:08.284
Now it doesn't matter as long as we have something.

21 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:12.789
And then we gotta start.

00:02:38.776 --> 00:02:57.358
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, should probably start on that in like the next two days and we can practice over the weekend. Yep. Actually wait, is this, how long is this? I didn't look at the.

30 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:02:57.358 --> 00:03:02.078
Are we even guidelines for it on LMS or like did he? He didn't post anything.

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:10.622

34 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:17.661

36 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:25.175

37 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:35.275
Anything to report for today? Can I whip it up.

38 "Adam" (448950784)
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:59.858
Yeah, can you mute yourself real quick? Yeah, I didn't hear the hell so I just did some prelim stuff for the classes page, nothing to like actually show off because yeah moving to see other stuff so I'll pull that together hopefully by Sunday, at least like something.

39 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:03.270
Thing to show a little bit.

40 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:20.400
Thank you. Cool. That sounds good. I was just saying to Christian earlier that I did all the, the login and register stuff in the authentication and I think that's already merged so I merged that last night.

41 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:42.264
Okay cool, thank you but yeah besides that, that's pretty much it. When you're testing with like login, and register, make sure you download the.env file or also won't function correctly. But that's pretty much it.

42 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:46.634
Do you guys have anything else?

43 "Thomas, Mius" (597244928)
00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:49.480
Oh, you two got it right for two.

44 "Adam" (448950784)
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.124
I think we're good to go then.

45 "Christian" (4262759680)
00:04:51.124 --> 00:05:06.180
Right, see you guys. I see you guys in. I got neither. Can you look at my.
