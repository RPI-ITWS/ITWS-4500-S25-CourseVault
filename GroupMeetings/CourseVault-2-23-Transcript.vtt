1 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.157
Yeah, we're good. All right. Great. Alright, so have you guys gotten anything done? Cause we kind of gotta get like a lot of things done and I really don't have any time.

2 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:27.581
I got more data added to the, the backward I I got my backwards you all to Okay, I think we need to all focus on front end.

3 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:43.745
Yeah, like for like just forget about the back end. As long as it works, like as long as something pops up, something pops up. We need to really focus on the front end, so and the presentation because I'm not gonna be I I really don't have like much time to like work on it.

4 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.941
What is our presentation?

5 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:52.498
Tuesday, it's on Tuesday. Oh NO, yeah. Yes. It's literally in two days, Doc, so.

6 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:00:52.498 --> 00:01:03.637
We got like we gotta like make like a slideshow and we gotta make like a good enough front end by that day and I really don't have time cause I got two exams coming up so I'm I'm kind of like locked out.

7 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:04.977
Okay, I will.

8 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:21.199
What I will say is presentation we don't have to worry about, we can I can do that like myself pretty much obviously I'm not just gonna do like you guys can see it, but we can do that like an hour. It's really the front that we need to work on. I was also gonna say do we want to beat tomorrow also?

9 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:23.762
To like do that. No, I can't meet tomorrow, dr.

10 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:27.121
Yeah, we both of us can't meet tomorrow because we have offices.

11 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.397
Yeah, we got offices. That's what I'm saying, that's why like I kind of.

12 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:32.777
Tuesday?

13 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:01:32.777 --> 00:01:34.139
On on Monday night.

14 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:01:34.139 --> 00:02:00.414
So I don't want to be like a dick, but like it's our midterm presentation to be fair. Like I also have two exams on Thursday so like I completely understand it's just, you know. Yeah, just like a little bit. I'm probably gonna do I'm probably not gonna leave my desk from now until tomorrow. So we don't focus on.

15 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:02:00.414 --> 00:02:02.916
Back end anymore. I think we should just focus on front.

16 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:27.652
Okay but here's the one thing with the Okay, we we can do the, if we do if we here's the thing with the the midterm presentation for my what I've seen. It's with what we have right now we have a, we basically have done half of the front end and half of the back end. And he said either have like one like as long as we've shown progress, we're gonna do fine.

17 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:46.458
We need to have enough front end, so it's not just about showing progress, it's like we need to have a front end like pretty much done to show, at least we need to have like the main pages done. So we actually kind of have to lock in for the next few days. This is kind of what I've been saying and.

18 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:02:46.458 --> 00:03:00.416
I mean it's not complicated, you just gotta it's just putting in work because like it's the back end stuff that's gonna take the most time. So we just gotta throw pages together. The other thing about if it's gonna be our final page is show something.

19 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:03.776
What do we currently have? Cause I haven't even I haven't even checked that, so.

20 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:20.096
We have we have the backward page completely done, which ok great with with like 30 different PDFs of dummy data and a search feature and filter feature. Let me see.

21 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:28.998
Wow, ok, that's a lot of, that's a lot of commits. Holy crap, what did I missed? Okay, you said I need like an env file, so like, could you like run me through how to.

22 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:38.717
Yeah, so all all you need to do is take that yeah Mayas said he you need to download the EMV file and give me 1 s, let me get to my computer.

23 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:44.217
Hold up dog, where's that EMB file? Cause I'm kinda, if I'm gonna be working on this, I'm gonna be working on this.

24 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:47.019
Today. Oh, ok. Here it is. I've.

25 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.099
Yeah alright where do we put the CMV fi.

26 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.977
Let me pull up the folder.

27 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:51.977 --> 00:03:54.557
I got it downloaded by the way.

28 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:56.836
Yeah, let's see.

29 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:00.355
I'm assuming we put it in our.

30 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:04.456
You just put it right in the root, the root folder.

31 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:08.134
Right, so.

32 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:08.134 --> 00:04:13.275
And, when you do make sure it's saved as.env and not just env.

33 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:16.098
Oh ok because it's right now it's.

34 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:20.958
Make sure you reading dot.env. Is that all the.

35 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.377
We need and then we just run normally.

36 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:45.059
Right. I believe it's, the way Mias did it is it's now it's node CRSRC/server server yeah ok yeah when you sign up, it will save your stuff to the.

37 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.382
Oh, it says it says cannot find module.en.

38 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:53.077
Oh yeah, just do npm.install oh yeah NPM install.

39 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:55.320
MPM install what? Yeah.

40 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.578
Just NPM install it'll see what modules you're missing, it'll install it for you. Okay.

41 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:05:03.578 --> 00:05:06.011
Yeah, this is also what I would say it's like.

42 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:24.737
Just have it working so someone's computer like does how to run the MV. Oh, ok, ok. So now I go to local. All right, great, it's there. So how does the login work? We log in. Is there like a username hold up? We gotta get this login feature like pretty much.

43 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:05:24.737 --> 00:05:29.878
Working. It does work. You just need to sign up.

44 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:32.475
Well, you know, we already have a dummy accounts.

45 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:40.217
Yeah, let me try and pull up what he put his as. I'm just gonna.

46 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:44.576
I like use, oh, I can't use passwords cause I don't know I guess we have to, I can make one though right.

47 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:53.558
Yeah, you can. Yeah, just make your own dummy account cause that's what I did and he also has one or two of them.

48 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:05:53.558 --> 00:06:02.098
Is there like a username? You said there's a username field, but there is NO username field for.

49 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:06:02.098 --> 00:06:04.737
Oh, what does it appear as?

50 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:07.519
Email. Oh I'm guessing the email.

51 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:21.913
Yeah, yeah. Cause that we should fix that, but that's fine for now, it doesn't matter. Well I mean it it's fine because right now that's the primary way we're gonna eventually like restrict like if you're not, you have to have a R like RPI.

52 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:06:21.913 --> 00:06:26.776
Email I guess. Okay, so then we should change the database field from username to email.

53 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:33.480
Yeah, well, we'll do that. Yeah communication.

54 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.456
Wow, so this all works.

55 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:46.015
Yeah, so the login, my, my is to the login and it got the the back that back end working. That that was all of him.

56 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:57.537
Okay. Hey, there's a few problems with this, with this backward page that I really don't like. I don't like the white color.

57 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:06:57.537 --> 00:07:02.915
I think a piece of paper in a manila folder look.

58 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:13.797
Okay, but like we should probably keep it with the website theme. So like, I mean if we're not using white as like a our color from the color template, right?

59 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:20.899
That's a that's a quick fix you could do. Yeah, that's what I mean. Just change that. That's for later, that doesn't matter.

60 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:33.759
For now. Also, I don't know if there's a way you could do this but have like the PDF like kind of like display, like kind of how you drew it out or like it kind of like, it's like its own like little box or like icon instead of just being like a list.

61 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:54.180
Yeah, I was gonna try and do that. I didn't know exactly how to do that without using installs and I have never used the installs and that would be trying to make sure I don't install something that's bad because Callihan did say to be careful about. I don't know.

62 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.175
What is this? That's cool. Wait, so how did you manage to upload the the PDF?

63 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:08.256
I manually inputted them. I, I was gonna work on making an imp upload page later.

64 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:11.598
But, oh again.

65 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:34.379
And what we could do is just like bake an upload page, like he could even like chat GBT just like a basic front end page. And then you just tell him tomorrow like us like it's not working yet because he doesn't care. It's just about progress cause like that happened so many times last year where kit like teams would show pages and then, oh, it's not working yet, we'll get it working. But I'd rather have the main three pages work.

66 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:37.301
So yeah, obviously, but again that's.

67 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:40.401
Like it's not.

68 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:43.469
Yeah, but also keep in mind.

69 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:08:43.469 --> 00:09:02.034
From when we did, at least when we did ours, we, we just had it looking like this and we say and when we, and when we said oh well we're gonna do this, it's not working right now, but this is what we're going to do. Callihant give us full credit because Callihant understands you're, you're only halfway.

70 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:09:02.034 --> 00:09:07.320
Yeah, that's what I was saying. Thank you. But we should still have like the majority of the main.

71 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.339
Stuff done, that's what I'm saying.

72 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:23.421
What can we get done with in the next 48 h plus getting around the offices tests and I also have some AI test on Tuesday morning before this class. So it's What can we get done?

73 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:30.561
Is we could just have like a dummy version of the professors in the schedule page. That's what we could try to get done.

74 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:59.643
Right, what we should do is write out what we want done, put in the chat cause I'm like, I don't know literally the only thing I can also go down and do it. Well just like write down everything and we can just be like, this will be done like and then this we can just put a dummy thing up because again like I don't really have to do anything until midterm and then I kind of have to lock in. So I've kind of like, I can like try to go down the list and just make minor edits and just make it presentable essentially while you guys can study for Opsys and whatever else.

75 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:04.840
Yeah, can you Adam, can you tackle the, what was it called.

76 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.747
The class page? Excuse me.

77 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:14.825
Excuse me guys. I'll I'll jump on the upload page and then add that to the backward one since I've already.

78 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:21.404
Alright guys, I put it in the chat what we need done. So we should that's all we really need to do like that's like the.

79 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:50.282
I was I was gonna say earlier that like I've like have a basic class page or there's not much functionality that just lists out classes. I guess what I could do, I don't get stuff man, I don't have a good I'll I'll push it when I actually like make the CSS nicer. I don't have a good idea how it's supposed to link to the rest of the website, so like for now like my plan was just to if you click so like class one's piece off you just click on it and then a pop up menu like comes up that's just like professor whatever and I guess I could put a link to something else.

80 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:10:50.282 --> 00:11:08.782
Here's what we could do for that. We could do like a rating. We could put that on like the professor/ratings. How about this? We, we renamed the professors page to the ratings page and because that's what we were gonna originally have. I don't even know why we called it professors cause it's not just about professors. We're gonna have ratings for like courses and for different professors.

81 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:10.055
Right? Yeah.

82 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:12.840
Yeah cause it was like right my.

83 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.502
Professor. So it was kind of like a.

84 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:18.539
Yeah, but we should we should call it.

85 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:22.866
Yeah, we can do that. Okay, good, good stuff.

86 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:11:22.866 --> 00:11:27.863
Yeah reconvene tomorrow. I can also do you.

87 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:11:27.863 --> 00:11:37.299
For that class page you could just push it to the for the professors page. Like you could have the the class page just a link to the proper.

88 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:39.021
Processors page for like on the rating.

89 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:11:39.021 --> 00:12:05.862
Or something. Yeah, yeah. And just like maybe like make it tailored towards like ratings. I don't know if you can have like a dummy, like, all you need is I'll click something and then you guys can see it. Okay. So what are we doing with we don't have a profile page alright we just won't access that, that doesn't matter. We need to fix some of these links.

90 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:09.094
Which ones are broken?

91 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:25.962
Well, what's broken is that we should not be seeing login and sign up. I don't know why we're seeing that. I literally changed to fix that. So that broke. When, when you're logged in, you shouldn't be seeing a login and sign up, a tab, so I don't know why.

92 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:12:25.962 --> 00:12:27.240
Are in the navoid.

93 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:46.206
Yeah, I I literally fixed that and then someone decided to That's weird or something ****** with something. What the hell doug? Come on. Yeah, why, why aren't we seeing that? Oh, I know why we're seeing that.

94 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:50.585
Is it because we're using the JS and not the JSX?

95 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:12:50.585 --> 00:13:03.059
Up never mind. I, I I *******, why are we Why are you seeing that?

96 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:21.479
I forget where were the more button. This is annoying ok This is what we shouldn't be seeing. So where was this edited?

97 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:31.365
Okay, so I can fix that. I can work on fixing.

98 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:13:31.365 --> 00:13:33.186
Doing that. Yeah, NO worries.

99 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:58.029
But basically, it's gonna, and it doesn't even work for some reason, so why, why doesn't it work? Alright, whatever. So we gotta make these links work. So I'll work on that. I'll work on making all these links work as nicely as possible. And then Adam.

100 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:13:58.029 --> 00:13:59.686
Yeah.

101 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:13:59.686 --> 00:14:07.425
You can start creating a slideshow, right? And can you put it inside the like google drive folder?

102 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:10.920
Yeah, I'm just gonna copy what my group did last year cause we got around.

103 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.972
Yeah just like we presented.

104 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:26.819
We present like what is it, what does it do? How does it like back and forth or not pushed out, but like well like we did like like our server was configured like security stuff and then live demo feedback and questions and that's right.

105 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:29.679
Okay, how long is this supposed to be? Do we have like an s.

106 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:38.795
What Ten groups? Ten groups and 50 min, and then you're gonna buy us like 20 min for moving around.

107 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:44.359
The start. Well, it's, we have a we have an a hundred and 10 min in the period.

108 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:48.778
Yeah, so say 90 min for 13 or.

109 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:14:48.778 --> 00:14:50.959
Yeah, 90 minister 13 group.

110 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.939
Groups, maybe 10 min per.

111 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:57.418
But I'll ask, some of my friends that.

112 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:01.677
My guess we're gonna have to present for at least 5 min.

113 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:15:01.677 --> 00:15:02.634
Yeah.

114 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:03.180
Yeah, I thought.

115 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:14.637
It's probably like presentation will be like 3 min. The the live demo could be like 5 min and then 2 min Q and A or something like that.

116 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:17.318
I'm gonna canate, should I ask Callian about.

117 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:23.853
Yeah sure can't hurt Cause he never say, he didn't say anything.

118 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:15:23.853 --> 00:15:28.319
Ask cause it was the. I don't know cause he's, you know, calling him.

119 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:15:28.319 --> 00:15:47.959
Yes, ok, I DM Tim, so hopefully he'll give me an answer.

120 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:53.098
Is.

121 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:15:53.098 --> 00:15:59.226
Yeah, cause I I also have peace offed on Wednesday so and I haven't even started making that crib sheet.

122 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.188
Okay.

123 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:03.324
So I'm I'm kind of screwed for.

124 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:16:03.324 --> 00:16:06.945
That, piece off warm wasn't too bad. I don't.

125 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:15.607
I'm more worried about piece off than offices, so I hope that gives I'm not feeling too bad about offices I think I.

126 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:23.426
Think, I think I'll be fine once I get into that one. It's just I don't know with goalshipment you don't know until you see the test.

127 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:31.187
It's gonna be mostly multiple choice with a bunch of like open ended questions. So.

128 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:16:31.187 --> 00:16:47.593
Yeah, but I'll get that upload page add add on to the the backward going and then we'll, and then Adam, you get the, the classes done and then we can just copy and paste that page over to professors and then just change up some of the wording.

129 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:16:47.593 --> 00:16:51.428
All what we'll do is we'll quickly, like, highlight.

130 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.783
And then move on to the next one.

131 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:16:53.783 --> 00:17:01.205
Yeah, because like basically I've just made like I, I picked eight, but however many, I just made a div and then there's information.

132 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:17:01.205 --> 00:17:02.486
Yeah.

133 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:17:02.486 --> 00:17:04.386
Something crazy.

134 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:17:04.386 --> 00:17:11.009
Exactly. So, yeah, we, we can just be asked the way that one looks once we get past the press.

135 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:18.308
Okay, wait, so who's, who's making this class scheduler?

136 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:26.806
Like the the dummy stuff. I thought Adam already had a little bit worked on that. Was that the one that you had? That's for the rating.

137 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:17:26.806 --> 00:17:33.065
But like we have also have a class scheduler page. Like, are we gonna make a dummy version of that.

138 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:17:33.065 --> 00:17:47.245
That. Yeah, it could probably make a dollar one or just say like we're implementing it in the future because like you can and if we don't if we don't have any yeah we're planning on making a scheduler page, we're gonna implement it in the future, like it doesn't matter. We just have to like.

139 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:17:47.245 --> 00:18:05.228
Any progress? Here's my thing. If we have, we basically have a working backward page and right now if Adam gets on the front end for the professors page, we're effectively halfway done with the project. So being at that stage at the midterm, we should not be docked any points.

140 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:08.906
Yeah, and also he's a very lightwriter, I mean you guys.

141 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:18:08.906 --> 00:18:19.469
I mean I don't I want to get a hundred on this after that. So I don't I don't care, like if we get a 95, I'll I'll consider that a loss Doug. I'd wanna get a hundred on.

142 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:18:19.469 --> 00:18:22.772
This presentation. Yeah, NO worries, we'll do that.

143 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:18:22.772 --> 00:18:25.343
Yeah my friend.

144 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:18:25.343 --> 00:18:29.130
You said that 5 min for the slides and 5 min for the presentation.

145 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.127
Okay.

146 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:18:30.127 --> 00:18:31.748
Okay, what do you mean 5 min for the.

147 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:33.804
Presentation, like the lab demo.

148 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:38.046
The demo, so we gotta make a 5 min demo. So that's why I see we gotta get some front end.

149 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:48.865
Yeah, so we could do that and then we can meet again tomorrow, like I was saying, just to kind of run through the presentation and run through how long we think the slides are gonna be or what the demo's gonna be.

150 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:18:48.865 --> 00:18:56.044
Okay, and then, when do we wanna meet tomorrow?

151 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:18:56.044 --> 00:18:59.805
I should be good anytime. Let me just check though.

152 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.721
Probably, after.

153 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:19:02.721 --> 00:19:05.366
I would assume it's like matter Ted, right?

154 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:19:05.366 --> 00:19:07.764
Yeah, you wanna do like 09:00 P.M.?

155 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:19:07.764 --> 00:19:10.203
Yeah, we could do 09:00 p.m..

156 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:19:10.203 --> 00:19:14.244
Does that work with you?

157 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:19:14.244 --> 00:19:15.746
I don't think it's probably even.

158 "Thomas, Mius" (99674112)
00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:19.806
Sorry, oh yeah, what's up?

159 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:19:19.806 --> 00:19:32.726
Yeah. Yeah I think we should be good also the login stuff when I signed up, everything got saved and it looks good.

160 "Thomas, Mius" (99674112)
00:19:32.726 --> 00:19:36.962
Wait, what time did it be the USA you wanted to meet again?

161 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:19:36.962 --> 00:19:45.789
Tomorrow because we're gonna try and add one or two more things to make this look a little bit more polished for our.

162 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:52.647
Presentation or just to run over the presentation like so we don't just walk in a class on Tuesday and not know what we're doing.

163 "Thomas, Mius" (99674112)
00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:56.765
Yeah, sure. I mean we can count.

164 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:19:56.765 --> 00:20:00.925
One is like one of the meetings, but we don't have to record it. It's not really it.

165 "Thomas, Mius" (99674112)
00:20:00.925 --> 00:20:04.126
I would assume we also don't need our.

166 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:20:04.126 --> 00:20:06.626
Wednesday because we don't really have anything to discuss because spring breaks.

167 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:20:06.626 --> 00:20:11.285
Coming up. Yeah. Yeah if we're not meeting on Wednesday then we definitely.

168 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:14.083
You have to record it. He's probably gonna expect this to meet two times.

169 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:14.742
This week.

170 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:20:14.742 --> 00:20:24.763
Yeah. All right, so maybe we can record tomorrow just because it doesn't matter. Yeah. Just record and whatever. Don't me and then don't be it on Wednesday. Yeah.

171 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:20:24.763 --> 00:20:29.098
Yeah, and one thing will be good. Right.

172 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:40.623
Good. So, ok, Sounds good. Alright, I'll get working on the fixing some of the navigation.

173 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:20:40.623 --> 00:20:45.983
Yeah, I'll get that upload page, at least looking like it does.

174 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:20:45.983 --> 00:20:52.963
Yeah, and make make if you can make the backward page like just look a little nicer, like get rid of the white like stuff.

175 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:20:52.963 --> 00:20:54.862
Yeah.

176 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:20:54.862 --> 00:21:02.702
Yeah, I don't know if you'll be able to I mean, yeah, you probably won't for the next 48 h, so I guess you can keep it as a list, but.

177 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:21:02.702 --> 00:21:03.590
Okay.

178 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:20.039
Yeah, yeah. Is there a way to hold up? I'm gonna I'm curious I'm trying to look in your.

179 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:38.642
Yeah, that's cool, ok, so it works. Yeah, I like how you, I like how you styled like the suggestions in the search, like that kind of coloring, that's good. I'm trying to make it that same coloring like throughout.

180 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:21:38.642 --> 00:21:42.702
You know. Yeah, and also make it take up the entire screen.

181 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:21:42.702 --> 00:21:49.901
Not just like half the screen cause you know, and have like a little header. I don't know if you can actually the header doesn't matter, just make it take up the entire.

182 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:21:49.901 --> 00:22:09.580
Screen yeah right now the head, the height works based off of how many, what was it bumps there are or how many yeah I have it so that it only drops down at most like ten items just so that it's not like cause on my small screen it's fine and then I blow it up on a big screen and then it looks wonky or vice.

183 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:30.401
Okay what you can to make the styling good? Yeah. Just so that we can because we're probably gonna be displaying that quite a bit since the other pages won't be like fully working. So if we, is he actually, do he actually have to have a 10 min presentation? Cause that's pretty wild.

184 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:38.720
My my guess is that's like the like limit is he he he's he broke it down as essentially five.

185 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:45.380
But if he wants if that's the limit then he wants it to be that.

186 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:22:45.380 --> 00:23:09.679
I mean, he, from what I've understand with his presentation or his things is as long as if it says if he says 10 min and you're like above eight, then you're good. Like, as long as you're not well under the limit, you're fine. And as long as you have shown that you've done actually done work together as a group, you're good. And since we have a we have the ability.

187 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:27.959
When you login, we have the ability to, to download data and we already have like we we've established our server works, our, well, yeah, our API works, we are working on the back end and the front end, but we both have working models for both, for most of for at least half of our pages.

188 "Marinkovich, Christian" (598586880)
00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:33.019
Good. All right.

189 "Collins, Joshua" (4276840960)
00:23:33.019 --> 00:23:39.997
Yeah, so with that, I'll beat you guys a good day and, we'll see you guys tomorrow.

190 "Adam" (2117586944)
00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:41.136
Yeah.
